    <p>
    To setup Pants in your repo:
    <pre>
      curl -L -O https://pantsbuild.github.io/setup/pants
      chmod +x pants
    </pre>
    The only requirement is that you have a python 2.7 interpreter somewhere on
    your PATH.
    </p>
    <p>
    The first time you run the new <code>./pants</code> script, it will install
    the latest Pants version and generate a config file <code>pants.ini</code>
    for you. On subsequent runs, the script will find the already installed
    Pants and run it.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you would like to use Pants plugins published to PyPi, you can configure them as
    follows in <code>pants.ini</code>:
    <pre>
      [GLOBAL]
      pants_version: 1.14.0

      plugins: [
          'pantsbuild.pants.contrib.go==%(pants_version)s',
          'pantsbuild.pants.contrib.scrooge==%(pants_version)s',
        ]
    </pre>
    Pants will notice you changed your plugins and install them.
    </p>
    <p>
    NB: The formatting of the plugins list is important; all lines below the
    `plugins:` line must be indented by at least one white space to form logical
    continuation lines.  This is standard for Python ini files, see
    <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822.html#section-3.1">RFC #822</a>
    section 3.1.1 for the full rules Python uses to parse ini file entries.
